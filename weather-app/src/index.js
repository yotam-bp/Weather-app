// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change

// Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
// 1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
// 2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
// 3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app
// See https://reactjs.org/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.
